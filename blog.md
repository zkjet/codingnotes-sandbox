Android studio by jetbrains is a new world. Never worked with Kotlin either, didn't have the hard drive space in the past. Lots of build tasks going on just to get started.

[X] Installed android studio sdk
[X] Created new hello world android project
[X] Installed xcode dependencies and SDK
[X] Created new project, investigated how views work
[X] Added .gitignore items for both android and ios
[X] Built android project successfully in IDE without errors
[X] Built ios project successfully in IDE finally without errors

Challenges:

- ios xcode broke on running simulator. Needed to install simulator packages for iphone, watch, and tv. - By far android studio has the most dependencies just to get up and running.
- Android studio complained about heap size, needed to restart with new requirement which went smoothly.
- Android simulator broke, needed to install a few. Forgot how many diffferent devices and screen sizes there are out there. Each one is nearly a gig of data in size. ðŸ¤¦

Asked ChatGPT:
 What is the most popular android phone on the market today?

GPT Answers:

It's difficult to pinpoint a single most popular Android phone on the market, as popularity can vary depending on factors such as region, price, and features. However, according to recent market reports and sales figures, some of the most popular Android phones on the market currently are:

Samsung Galaxy S21 series
Samsung Galaxy Note20 series
Google Pixel 5 and 4a
OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro
Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 and Note 10 Pro
It's important to note that popularity can change over time, and new Android phones are released frequently, so it's always a good idea to do your research before purchasing a new device.

I seriously had no idea, it's been over a decade since I've even used an android phone. So "Samsung Galaxy S21 series" is #1 according to chatGPT, very interesting. I wonder how android devs account for so many different devices opposed to ios developers easy of only a few. Strange.
